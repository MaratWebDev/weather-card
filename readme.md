I decided to showcase my skills in plain non-preprocessor and frameworks environment and in understanding fundamentals of languages and fluency with API requests. I also used modern practices such as ES6, Fetch, CSS Grid and CSS animation eg. @keyframes. I have previously developed a similar feature but using Angular and Progressive Web Apps.

First, I build HTML structure and functionality. I allocated all necessary variables, created API data requests, and parsed it into JSON format. Then I could get the data I needed.

I designed the app with the mobile first approach. I built a single column card which changes into more columns on wider viewports. I used CSS Grid for building the layout, creating and allocating areas.  

I enjoy creating non-standard designs. I added animation to the top border and temperature background which is synchronised. Furthermore, the colour palette has good contrast ratio for accessibility purpose.

As next step, I would add another function which will allow will refresh the page dynamically to request another API.
